TnSeq has been used extensively in _M. tuberculosis_ genetic research and identification of gene essentiality (TnSeq) profiles is important for predicting gene function. However, these profiles are buried across dozens of research papers within supplementary materials which makes querying them cumbersome. The MtbTnDB solves this problem by building a central repository of TnSeq screens performed in _M. tuberculosis_, and allows users easy access to data through an interactive web-app. A demo version of the app is available in this repository and is hosted [here](https://mtbtndb-demo.herokuapp.com/analyze_datasets).  

Details of this database and access to the complete web-app will be published in the following manuscript (in preparation):

__The M. tuberculosis transposon database (MtbTnDB): a large-scale guide to genetic essentiality__
